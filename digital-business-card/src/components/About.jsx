                Hi! I'm Ibrahim, I'm a Backend Engineer currently working on building REST APIs with Flask Frawmework and automation scripts with Python.
                I'm currently learning NodeJS and ReactJS to expand my knowledge on FrontEnd development and mainly Javacript programming.
                I'm looking forward to switching to a Fullstack web development role with Python and JS.
            </p>
